https://parceljs.org/

what is npm ?

# Extension
- Better Comments
- Prettier More - Code formatter
- ESLint
# What a Funaction Component
- it's funaction it is normal function javascript function which returns same pc of react element ans same pic of jax code
# React Hooks
-There Is Normal JAVA Script Function
(Normal JS utility functions)
- Two Type Hooks
- useState();
- useEffect();

# What is this CORS policy ?
-> Are browser blocker to calling api from one origin to different origin , if there is origin mismatch the 
   browser block this api call that is a cors policy.

# what is shimmer ui
-> A shimmer UI is a version of the UI that doesn't contain actual content, but instead mimics the layout and 
   shapes of the content that will eventually appear

   # React Hooks
   (Normal JS utility funcation)

- useState() - Superpowerful state Varibales in react
- useEffect()

# 2 type of Routing in web apps
Why it's Single page Application
=> it just one just componenet it's changes
 
- Clinet Side Routing
=>  Client-side routing refers to the practice of handling navigation and page rendering on the user's device, enhancing web application interactivity.

- Server Side Routing
 => We mak  network call and that page tha about HTML comming form server is called Server Side Routing.

 # useEffect it is two argument

=> now i'am import my useEffect form react library(this a name imported) so spik vluve code,and the we have useEffect hooks over here which have 2 argument  1) 1 st is callback funcations and  
 2) 2 ed it is a offional argument  keep emty what happen .if have don't any Dependencie array over here than this useEffect we call every time my componenet render, 
 do have  meak every time my api call render it's no
 no it's fu lesh , i just have do it ones and initial remnder i will just use a emty Dependencie array 

 what is the life cycle of this react componenet

  # Who this componenet put up in the webpage 
  # who this componenet loaded in the webpage (we use the words mounted)

  # When will be useEffect is call/ When will fuction will we called ?
- After evary render useEffect called
- After each and evary render is my useEffect fucations will     called 
# What will be the call first time (render)
  => After first render  compoenetDidMount is called 

  and after sub equla render it's compoenetDidUpdate is called ther is diffreance between DidMount and DidUpdate 

  # When will be the call  compoenetWillUnmount call?
  - When  will be componentWillUnMount called is  when we are leving the page

  # what will be Clear/  when we leving the page ?
  - If have a setInterval and at set that okay do a console log of  a sushant react Op after evary seconed (waht will hapan ) it's started printing  sushant react OP after each seconed.
  - When youre changeing  youre pages it is not reloading youre page, it's just changeing the components, it's just rendering the react is reconsling, it's power SPA but bad thing a single page application

# Chunking
# Code Splitting
# Dynamic Bundling 
- All of then JS file size and we have a lot of child componenets inside the evary compoenets are bundling the size
# Why to be called Lazy loading/ on demand loading?
- When are app load intialy  are app Home we load it will not load the code for Grocery, only when i go to my Grocery page then only Grocery  then will Grocery code in the app. that is know as lazy loading
